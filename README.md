Who doesn't love cats? It's why I created this WordPress Gutenberg block that displays a random cat image.

Have an amazing catsperience!

## Contribute
We welcome contribution in any capacity. Here are some guidelines to help you. In addition to the steps listed below, you can find more information about how to use `@wordpress/env` in the [WordPress Developer Resources](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/#usage).

### Installation
This project has been setup to use the [@wordpress/env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) npm package, but feel free to disregard the following steps and use something like [VVV](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) or anything else that you already know.

You need to set up your environment first by [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). You also need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and running.

### Running it
`wp-env start --xdebug`

and to ensure your files are up to date on the container.

`npm run start`

You can now open [http://localhost:8888/wp-admin/](http://localhost:8888/wp-admin/). The username is `admin` and the password.... drumrolll... `Â password`.

### Linting

#### JavaScript /Â React
`npm run lint:js`

#### CSS
`npm run lint:css`

#### PHP
Follow the WordPress Coding Standards [installation instructions](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards#installation).
`phpcs gutencat.php`

##### Package.json
`npm run lint:pkg-json`

*There is a "Invalid value for license" error even if `Unlicense` is a valid [SPDX identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/). There must be a problem with `wp-scripts lint-pkg-json`*

#### Markdown
`npm run lint:md`

### Testing
#### End-to-end (E2E)
**Please backup your folder before running this command** as for weird unknown reasons I didn't find yet, it sometimes (!!) delete all the non code files (!!!!)...

`npm run test:e2e`

## What's next
I have some other things I want to implement.
- Specify the cat's breed.
- Specify TheCatAPI's category (i.e.: a cat in a sink).
- Search the file type.
- Add a static picture setting: instead of having a random cat picture each time the page containing the block is loaded, the WordPress administrator could check this option when adding a box. It will fetch a random image that will be saved with the block. Obviously, the user will be able to refresh the image until they get what they want.
- Who knows, maybe even submit it to the [Gutenberg blocks directory](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-plugin-guidelines/blob/block-guidelines/blocks.md)!
